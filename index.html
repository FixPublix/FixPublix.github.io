<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Don't have time to read the whole ramble? Sure, this is the short version.</p>
<p>Publix is trying to weasel their way out of giving an overwhelming majority of its hourly employees proper raises. Even if you are in the small minority that this doesn't affect immediately, it will in due time, as this change will continually push everyone towards the bottom of any given pay scale in a long enough time period.</p>
<p>This is obvious and glaring to those that know how to look for it, but most do not, and it is kept purposefully concealed from you.</p>
<p><u>Do not accept any performance evaluations until you have, in writing, what your raise is going to be, and you can independently confirm that it is correct. For more information, see the </u><strong><u>Well, what can </u></strong><i><strong><u>we</u></strong></i><strong><u> do?</u></strong><u> section under The Long Version.</u> I do recommend you read at least that section in order to gain a better understanding of the entire situation.</p>

<h2>The Long Version</h2>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>You probably already know the answer to this question. If you don't, you do not need to. Just know that I am a long-term part-time hourly employee, just like the overwhelming majority of you.</p>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>A simplistic website made for the purpose of explaining the situation at Publix in far more detail than can be done in person, or on a card.</p>
<h3>What's the situation?</h3>
<p>Before 2022, Publix operated in a fairly simplistic manner with regard to performance evaluations and raises. Performance evaluations and raises were given out twice a year, 6 months after your hire date, and a year after your hire date. Pay scale increases, being the minimums and maximums that any given job class could have, were adjusted in January.</p>
<p>This meant that if you were hired in August, you would receive your evaluations in February and August, along with pay increases.</p>
<p>As of 2022, this is no longer the case. In 2022, evaluations were changed to once a year, with the entire store being done in August, but larger pay raises to offset the longer time period between evaluations.</p>
<p>This, alone, is fine, and in 2022, things continued to operate as normal, with pay scale increases happening in January.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. As of 2023, Publix has decided to try to pull a fast one on their employees.</p>
<p>As of 2023, all performance evaluations, and raises, happen in August, at the exact same time (down to the week) that pay scale changes take effect for everyone involved.</p>
<p>This, in and of itself, isn't even that bad. If this change is known about and planned around, it could work just fine. However, this is where things get unfair.</p>
<p>When your raise is calculated, it is calculated off of your performance review. If you are Meets Expectations, you are to receive a 5% raise. Exceeds Expectation, 7%. Role Model, 9%.</p>
<p>However, your raise is calculated off of your <strong>old</strong> wage, rather than taking your job's new pay scale into account.</p>
<p>Allow me to provide an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You work as a cashier. You are currently making $12/hr. You receive a performance evaluation, placing you at Meets Expectations. Your expected raise is 5%. Your entire job class is being moved up in pay, with cashiers making $13/hr minimum now. Your new pay is $13/hr.</p>
<p>“That sounds excellent.” You might think. A dollar raise is pretty good, after all, right?</p>
<p>No. You are being cheated out of an actual raise.</p>
<p>If this system was logical, your job class would move up to $13/hr <strong>first</strong>, then your 5% raise would be <strong>added to that.</strong> You should be making $13.65/hr.</p>
<p>The way the system works now is the precise opposite. Your 5% raise is calculated first, bringing your total up to $12.60/hr. As you then fall below the minimum of your job class, you are simply brought up to the minimum, and left there.</p>
<h3>Wow, that sucks.</h3>
<p>It does, and I intend to do something about it.</p>
<h3>Well, what can I do?</h3>
<p>I'll be frank with you, as an individual, not a whole lot. When I first discovered this in 2023, I was not happy about it. I brought it to the attention of both my immediate manager, and the store manager. In full defense of both, both later got back to me with answers to the questions posed to them, so I know very well that they did make my concerns heard. They both receive full marks for that. Unfortunately, the answers I received were not satisfactory to me, and thus I elected to press the matter further. I brought the matter to the attention of our District Manager. This earned me a sit down with the RARS, or Retail Associate Relations Specialist. No satisfactory answers were given there, either, thus I moved to the next higher manager on the list, which earned me a sit down with the RARS again, and a District Manager. Yet again, no satisfactory answers were given. I could well see the writing on the wall at this point, and knew that continuing to raise my point to higher and higher managers would simply result in wasting the time of our RARS in driving down here from Lakeland every few weeks, whilst essentially being told no in a very roundabout and corporate way.</p>
<p>This sat quite poorly with me indeed. I was unhappy, and intended to pursue this further, but I quickly found myself up against a wall in terms of practical options. Nothing I could say or do as an individual would get anything done here. I was but one voice of 240,000. I knew others were unhappy about the same thing, and I voiced my concerns to them, too, and encouraged them to speak up as well, but I knew that it was likely all going to get filtered right into the metaphorical Feedback Shredder at corporate. After all, operating this way saves them money. My only options remaining were a unified movement, or attempting to form a Union. As the very concept of a union is grounds to get you fired at Publix, I instead elected to wait, and bide my time to think up alternatives. Now, one year, and a considerable amount of thought later, here we are.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Well, what can <i>we </i>do?</h3>
<p>The opposition I have formed going forward is very simple. It is not a strike, it is not the formation of a union, it is simply a set of demands that each person reading this should make, not for me, but for their own sake, and the sake of their fellow employees.</p>
<p>Under absolutely no circumstances should you accept, sign, or hear out a performance evaluation given to you by any manager, unless, at the time of that performance review, they can provide, in writing, what your raise is going to be, and you are able to independently confirm that this is what your raise is <strong>supposed</strong> to be, by <strong>logical</strong> math, not Publix's twisted version. You must not bend or break with this. You cannot let a manager or anyone from corporate sweet talk you, or promise you something, in exchange for letting this be pushed through. If Publix continues to be successful with this, they will keep doing it forever.</p>
<p>The math is very simple. Take your current pay rate, which can be found on Passport at the bottom of the My Profile tab. Depending upon your performance evaluation, you will be adding a certain percentage to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your total evaluation score is Meets Expectations, that percentage will be 5%.</p>
<p>If your total evaluation score is Exceeds Expectations, that percentage will be 7%.</p>
<p>If your total evaluation score is Role Model, that percentage will be 9%.</p>
<p>You then compare the number you have calculated against the new minimums for your job class, which is information that managers should be able to provide for you. If they cannot, <u>do not accept your evaluation</u>.</p>
<p>If, after taking into account the new minimums for your job class, you are still receiving the appropriate 5/7/9% raise, your work here is done. Congratulations, you have won.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for most of us, we will find that this is not the case. We may find ourselves simply bumped up to meet the new minimum, and left there. You may find yourself getting only a 2% or 3% raise instead of your appropriate amount. If this is the case, <strong><u>do not accept your performance evaluation.</u></strong> Deny it, every time it is remade and re-presented to you, until <strong>after</strong> the pay scale changes, which, last year, occurred around August 22nd. At which point, you should find yourself in more favorable conditions, as Publix would be legally obligated to tack on your raise <strong>after</strong> your new minimum is raised.</p>
<h3>Can I get in trouble for this?</h3>
<p>No. Nowhere in the Employee Handbook is it mentioned that you can receive any form of reprimand for sending back a performance evaluation to be redone and reassessed. Similarly, any manner of retaliatory action against you, such as firing, a cutting of hours, transfer of departments, verbal or physical threats, increased scrutiny, lowering of subsequent performance evaluations, spreading rumors, or making work more challenging, among others, is, in fact, illegal under <strong>Federal Law.</strong></p>
<p>(Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eeoc.gov/facts-about-retaliation">United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>. For the laws enforced by the EEOC, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/laws-enforced-eeoc">Here</a>.)</p>
<p>Publix does <i>not</i> want a lawsuit on their hands. Publix has an <i>army</i> of lawyers on hand at any given time to protect their image, as it is one of the few things they have left going for them. A lawsuit such as this would put them in considerably hot water. As such, even if they <i>were</i> to take retaliatory action against you, you could sue them, and walk away with likely a very sizable settlement payment to keep you quiet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be noted that your manager has <i>remarkably</i> little to do with this. All of these changes were imposed by corporate, rather than any manager at a store level. They merely write your performance evaluation. Do not get angry at them, they are rather detached from this entire process.</p>
<h3>And if this doesn't work?</h3>
<p>Then the options are reduced to one. The formation of a Publix Union. Despite the propaganda that every corporate entity on planet Earth likes to shove down your throat, unions are rarely a bad thing. They <i>do</i> come with their ups and downs, but the reason they are so <i>vehemently </i>hated by corporations is the fact that they stop underhanded corporate shenanigans, like this, from happening in the first place. If Publix had a union, any pay rate changes would have to go through the union, and be approved by them <i>first. </i>Given that the union only exists and operates for the benefit of its employees, it is remarkably unlikely that they would accept such an underhanded tactic. And unions give the individual significantly more swinging power. If enough members of a union can agree that they dislike something, and wish to see it changed, unions can threaten strikes and shut down entire businesses until their demands are met. Something significantly harder to do when you are but one lowly individual. There is power in numbers, and it is high time that Publix was reminded of that.</p>
<p>With this said, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://forms.gle/P21nDYBDPFyzC3ka9">this is a link to a Google Forms survey</a>, which can be filled out anonymously, asking if you would be in favor of a Publix Union. This is entirely optional, and merely an attempt to gather opinions.</p>

<h2>Additional Thoughts, Points, and Rambling</h2>
<p>You've already read most of the important bits above. You have my sincere thanks and gratitude for even taking the time to read all of this thus far, regardless of what action you may or may not take. It means a lot to me.</p>
<p>Yet, as this is one of the few chances we have to speak openly about some of these topics, free from the time constraints of work and interrupting customers, there are a few additional points I would like to speak on. You are free to end your journey here, if you so wish. I know I can get somewhat rambly, so no hard feelings. But for those curious souls, venture onwards.</p>
<h3>Performance Evaluations</h3>
<p>Now, this is a topic that somewhat ties into all of the above, but is distinct enough from the main part that I consider it worth getting into separately. I have worked at several Publix's, under several managers, and in different parts of Florida. I can count the amount of times I have seen any employee get anything beyond Meets Expectations on my hands. I have known employees that have put in more work and dedication to Publix than some team leaders, and still get only Meets Expectations. If that is what passes for Meets Expectations, then what must you do to get Role Model? Singlehandedly put Winn-Dixie out of business using a pair of glasses and some pocket lint?</p>
<p>I do not consider performance evaluations as they stand to be an appropriate judge of the true performance of an employee. Whilst I have no proof of which to act on, I am fully under the impression that stores are likely not allowed to hand out more than a certain number of Role Model and Exceeds Expectations ratings per store, and everyone else simply gets filed under Meets Expectations. If performance evaluations are going to be directly tied to compensation, then you need to be accurate in your assessments- not purposefully undercutting people in order to avoid paying out.</p>
<h3>Compensation</h3>
<p>Publix's pay practices are not only borderline unfair for the reasons stated above, but completely unsustainable.</p>
<p>Let's start with a brief introduction of Inflation. Inflation is an inescapable fact of our current economic system. Without going into a rant about how this entire economic system is unsustainable, suffice to say that Inflation is essentially the continued devaluing of your currency, driving prices higher and higher, despite the product in question being generally worth the same.</p>
<p>Inflation is compounding. If you have something that costs $100, and inflation increases at a rate of 10% per year, after a year, the same item would be worth $110. Then, next year, it would be worth $121. Then, next year, $133. You can quickly begin to get into some exponential growth with this, following this tend.</p>
<p>In order for you to have the same purchasing power with your money, Publix's pay rates need to, <i>at the very least</i>, match inflation. They do not, and have not, for both years that they have switched to this new ‘percentage based’ raise system. You are doing the same work, and in some cases, even more, for ‘more’ money, that is objectively worth less than what you were getting paid last year.</p>
<p>Couple this with the fact that Publix offers some of the lowest starting wages among their competitors, and makes it actively impossible to move up in the pay scale, and it isn't hard to see why so many stores are perpetually understaffed. Why so many people have to subsume the roles of so many others, just to keep the stores afloat. Why so many people go home, exhausted and stressed out at the end of the day, because Publix refuses to do what is best for its employees.</p>
<p>The estimated living wage for an American in the modern day is currently $46,000/yr. Broken down into a typical 40 hour a week, 52 week year, this is just over a $22/hr pay rate. At the time of writing this, the only job classes that can reach that total in a full-time position, at the absolute top of their pay scale, are Meat Cutters and Sous Chefs. Both undoubtedly important and specialized roles, yes, but why are they the only ones even <i>allowed</i> to make a living wage on the hourly scale at Publix? Why are positions like Team Leads, which essentially are Mini-managers, not offered similar compensation? Why, even after signing your life away to Publix, will Publix still refuse to pay you a wage enough to be comfortable? Why does Publix forsake its hourly employees, when we are the ones who allow the store to operate in the day to day?</p>
<p>Better yet, why do we accept it?</p>
<h3>Managers/Corporate</h3>
<p>I have no doubt that at some point in time, a manager will manage to get their hands on this page, and it may even make the rounds up to Corporate. If that's you, then I'd like to take a moment to address you directly.</p>
<p>First off, I would like to offer my sincere apologies to any managers. I understand that you have very little to do with any of this. You are merely following your orders, and this is liable to put additional strain on your time and resources, both of which are already limited. It is not my intention to do so, nor is this any manner of ‘vendetta’ against any manager specifically. This is merely done because Publix has changed. I know that most managers reading this will have been around Publix long enough to know what I'm talking about. Publix has become so very heavily corporatized, that it is but a shell of its former self, getting by on what remains of its good name. Even in my comparatively limited time here, I have witnessed Publix's continued devolution. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be getting any better, and it is the hourly employees that suffer from this the most. Thus, when we take actions like this, know that, at least from the writer's perspective, I hold no ill-will against management at any store level. My issues stem from Corporate and Corporate alone.</p>
<p>Should this page make its way to Corporate, allow me to speak plainly. I despise you. I despise what you have become, and how little you care for the business that keeps you afloat, in your glass palace in Lakeland. You care only about growth. Expansion. Greed. Everything is done at the behest of the shareholders, which is exceptionally amusing, given the fact that Publix is an employee-owned company. Yet once again, the same power structures that show up in most major corporations rear their ugly head here again. Instead of taking care of your hourly workers, those who actually put in the effort to keep the business running, you focus all of your efforts on the top rung, and the expansion of your store into areas it had no purpose of being in. In my time at Publix alone, you have expanded into three new states. Why? Every state in the US has grocery chains that serve their neighborhoods. This is not some matter of charity or good will, you are doing this to expand your market share, and nothing else. You continually shaft the hourly employees, even when your competitors offer better. Your stores are perpetually understaffed, and it is certainly not hard to imagine why, when even Walmart outperforms you in terms of pay, and you would rather flood your stores with part-time employees that cycle in and out, as opposed to keeping a good staff of consistent, competent people aboard.</p>
<p>You have responses, you have comebacks, but it's all corporate talk that matters little in the real world. People are struggling to make ends meet, with 78% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. You can tout your benefits and such as much as you wish- they don't matter when most people can't access them, because getting full time at a store is remarkably challenging, even for those who dedicate to it. You can spout things about stock and ownership- they matter equally little when I can't buy a car, let alone a house, because all of my money goes just to staying alive.</p>
<p>You have become the very thing that you were created to be rid of. You have completely forsaken George Jenkin's Legacy, and he would have the heads of the company's leadership if they saw how Publix was being run today, not even 30 years after his death.</p>
<p>And yet, despite all of this, there is still time to change. There is time to steer the ship back on course. Cease your relentless expansion. Focus on giving back to your employees. You are a company that makes <i>billions</i> of dollars a year. You rival <i>Nike</i>, a worldwide company, with a grocery chain operating in the Southern US. You do not need to bring Publix to the world. You need to bring Publix back in line with George Jenkin's Legacy, and back to being a truly great place to work.</p>
<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>This has been a very long read, and if you have come this far, I appreciate you for reading it. Everything I have said, I say because, despite my qualms with Publix, I still see it as redeemable. I see it as capable of reaching the title of Great Place to Work once again, and being deserving of it. It saddens me deeply to witness just how far Publix has fallen in my lifetime, let alone in my time working here.</p>
<p>If I did not care, I would not have written all of this. I write these things because I do care. It would be much easier to simply leave Publix, and let the ship sink on its own, but I see there to be potential within it still. It is for that potential that I am willing to fight on.</p>
